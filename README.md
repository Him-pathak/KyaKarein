Title of the project: Kya Karein

Theme: AgroTech

Description:

The target of this project is to help and educate our loved farmers by resolving their Doubt regarding any field work by the experts present in the same platform.
This project is basically a platform where the experts help the audience(Farmers) and resolve their doubts. Since the experts would be less as compared to the number of questions , therefore the experts would give more importance to that question which has maximum upvotes.
The experts can answer a particular question through "add answer" column.

But, the biggest question is ; how is the poor , uneducated farmer know to chat in this platform?

This project has been made with minimum flaws! Therefore, since our poor farmer is unable to write, we have provided ask by VOICE feature wherein the farmer may directly ask doubt by clicking the audio button.

The interface has been made as simple as possible since our majority audience would be farmers.

DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERFACE:

1. On the left side , we have FEED , TUTORIALS , WEATHER options to help farmers in their daily work.
  * Feed will enable farmers to get to know what doubts have been listed
  * Tutorail will educate the farmers which would help in better production of crops
  * Weather will come very handy to farmers in their daily life.
2. On the right side , we have MANDI where the farmers can check the ongoing price of the seeds and the emotion of the market. This would help the farmers judge their pricings.
3. At the centre , we have the area to ask doubt and answers to help them.

If the farmer thinks that a particular question is very important to be addressed , then he can just upvote it and bring the attention of the experts to that question.


If the farmer remains unsatisfied with an answer, then he can downvote that answer and prevent others from considering that answer.

-> Let us consider a situation:
* The farmer wants to know when and how to sow a particular seed which he has not been grown .
* He will ask name the seed from the picture where he had taken .
* Then he will go to mandi column to get an idea of the ongoing price of the seed so that he gets seed at justifies price.
* After that , he will go to tutorials to underdtand the process of growing the crop.
* when can he sow the seed can be understood from the weather options.
* Then at the time of selling, he can get the prices of the crop and can negotiate with the local players accordingly.

Therefore , this is the simple yet effective tool that a common farmer might use to sustain .
